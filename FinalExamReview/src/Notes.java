	/*  Module 1 > 
	 * 	Output / Input 
	 * 	Variables (Types, Size, Heirachy)
	 * 			String (how it works w/ memory)
	 * 			double > float > byte
	 * 	Selections / Branching 
	 * 		if, if-else, if-else-if, switch (structure & breaks)
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Module 2 >
	 * 	Loops / Tracing Code
	 * 		For, While, Do-While, Enhanced For
	 * 	Arrays
	 * 		Create
	 * 		Single (how it's used)
	 *  	2D (read / trace)
	 *  Methods (Call, creating, return, static vs. non-static, scope / visibility)
	 *  
	 *  
	 * Module 3 >
	 * 	Classes
	 * 		objects vs class (classes are blueprints used to create objects through constructors)
	 * 		constructors ( can have multiples) (constructors are defined by class name)
	 * 		setters & getters
	 * 		private (self) / public (everyone) / protected (team) [visibility]
	 * 		overloading (within a class that has multiple methods with different arguments) 
	 * 		overwriting (when you inherit from a parent class and change it [i.e. toString])
	 * 	Exception handling (try/catch, basic)
	 * 	>NO file processing<
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Module 4 >
	 * 	Interface
	 * 		Abstract methods
	 * 		implementation of interfaces
	 * 	Abstract classes
	 * 		Extension
	 * 	Inheritance
	 * 		sub-classes
	 * 		visibility (what inherits what)
	 * 	"Family Tree"
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Housekeeping >
	 * 	Java standards
	 * 		Naming (Classes are capital, variables are lowercase)
	 * 		Logic ( || / && has a higher precedence)
	 * 	Terms
	 * 		Encapsulation - data corruption / one path
	 * 		Polymorphism - 
	 * 	Math (Integers + Doubles, Truncation, Promotion)
	 * 	Prefix / Postfix operators (++i, i++)
	 *
