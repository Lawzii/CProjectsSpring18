/*stack - FILO (first in last out)
        push - instert
        pop - remove
        top - head
  queue - linked list
        so 4, 16, 5, 3 will be |4 <- 16 <- 5 <- 3| so (4) is at the head of the queue and (3) is at the tail.
        remove - dequeue
        when you dequeue the first in line (the head) will be removed the next item in line will become the head - FIFO (first in first out)
